WSL2 has minimal options, switching to Virtual Box

Decided to go with a virtual machine based on Arch.
Should be a fun experience.
Installing Arch first pain point: vt-x is not enabled, googling it sounds like it is due to new windows feature called hyper-v, the solution I found is [[https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=87752]]

Arch experience is complete. The kernel I have is i686, Arch Linux requires x86_64.
shame, I thought I had a 64bit processor.
Debating about going back to Dual boot with Kubuntu or trying out in VM either Fedora or Manjaro.

I don't know what is wrong, but my system showcases I have 64bit infrastructure.

Decided to download and reinstall virtual box, maybe when I installed it previously I selected 32 bit.

It was the Virtual machine!
After downloading a new version i got Arch Linux installed.
Stopped working when Emily came home.
