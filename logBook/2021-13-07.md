- started researching distributions. Mainly the differences between Fedora, KDE neon and Manjaro.
- At this point I am leaning towards trying Manjaro.

- found out why I shouldn't go with either Fedora or Manjaro. They both seem to be running on "bleeding edge" technology, which means it will be occasions where thing will be broken. I didn't like fixing smaller issues on Kubuntu so I figured it's not for me.

- KDE Neon is an interesting new distro. They have a 'developer version', unfortunately it is based on their unstable build, which again comes with 'bleeding edge'. I might try it down the road one day but not right now.
- I started to think if I was unfair towards Kubuntu. After all, I first installed default Ubuntu with Gnome Desktop. I disliked it. I found KDE Desktops and thought I will like it. SO I deleted Gnome Desktop and installed KDE on Ubuntu. Was that smart? Probably not. Did I remove everything? Also, probably not. Was that a cause for issues with Ubuntu and KDE not working properly? It's very likely. Conclusion: I am giving Kubuntu a second shot, installing it from scratch, on a VM.
